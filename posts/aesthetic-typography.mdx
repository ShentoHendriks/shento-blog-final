## Using a Modern CSS Reset
Before you start creating typography, you should **always** first use a CSS Reset

Why? Every browser has different default styles—margins, padding, and font sizing that create inconsistencies across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. A CSS reset eliminates these differences, giving you a clean foundation for consistent typography.

<Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="Example reset.css">
```css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

* {
  margin: 0;
}
/* ... more lines here */
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
Many developers use [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), but [Josh Comeau's Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) is a better choice. While Meyer's reset aggressively strips all browser defaults, Comeau's approach is smarter—it removes inconsistencies while preserving useful behaviors.


### Key advantages of Comeau's reset:

- Universal box-sizing: `border-box`
- Better font rendering and typography defaults
- Preserves accessibility features
- Built for modern CSS (flexbox, grid)

If you use Tailwind CSS, you have a built-in CSS Reset called '[Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)'.

## Why You Need a Typescale
Without a systematic approach to font sizing, your typography becomes inconsistent and chaotic. You'll find yourself randomly picking sizes—making H2 headings 22px, then 24px, then 20px—creating visual discord that feels unprofessional and hard to scan.

### Establishing Your Typescale

A **typescale** solves this by creating consistent relationships between all your text elements. Start with your base font size: **16px** or **18px**—these are universally acknowledged as optimal for body text readability across devices and age groups. In CSS, the base font size is given to the `body`.
<Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="typography.css">
```css
body {
  font-size: 16px; /*default size for most browsers*/
} 
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>


From this foundation, use mathematical ratios to generate harmonious size typography.
Popular typescale ratios include:

- **1.125 (Major Second)** - subtle, conservative
- **1.25 (Major Third)** - balanced, versatile
- **1.414 (Augmented Fourth)** - dynamic, bold

### How does this work?
You start with a base font (like 16px), then **multiply by the ratio** to get each larger size, or **divide by the ratio** to get smaller sizes.

An elegant way to do this in web development is the following:

<Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="typography.css">
```css
:root {
  --base-size: clamp(1rem, 2cqw, 1.25rem); /* This scales with container! */
  --ratio: 1.25;

/* These automatically scale because base-size uses cqw */
  --scale-sm: calc(var(--base-size) / var(--ratio));
  --scale-base: var(--base-size);
  --scale-lg: calc(var(--base-size) * var(--ratio));
  --scale-xl: calc(var(--scale-lg) * var(--ratio));
  --scale-2xl: calc(var(--scale-xl) * var(--ratio));
  --scale-3xl: calc(var(--scale-2xl) * var(--ratio));
}

.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

h1 { font-size: var(--scale-3xl); }
h2 { font-size: var(--scale-2xl); }
h3 { font-size: var(--scale-xl); }
h4 { font-size: var(--scale-lg); }
p { font-size: var(--scale-base); }
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
You can can keep adding as much variables as you like even `--scale-10xl`.

Don't feel forced to give your `h1`
`--scale-3xl`, you can choose freely. Just choose something you find nice.

## Vertical Spacing

**Vertical spacing** is all about the empty space above and below your text. This includes the space between lines in a paragraph (called `line-height` by web developers and leading by designers) and the space (margin) between sections and elements (such as images, paragraphs) 

When vertical spacing isn't done well, it makes **reading much harder**. Text that's too cramped feels overwhelming and difficult to follow. Text with too much space feels choppy and disconnected, like the ideas don't belong together.

Good vertical spacing makes your content easier to read and more professional. It helps readers move naturally from one idea to the next and makes your text look clean and well-organized.

### Line Height Guidelines
For **line-height**, the rule is: **the smaller the text, the more line-height is needed**. An example you can follow is:
- **Body text**: 1.4–1.6 (times the **base** font)
- **Large headings (H1-H2)**: 1–1.2
- **Smaller headings (H3-H6)**: 1.2–1.4 

<Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="typography.css">
```css
body {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

h1, h2 {
  line-height: 1.2;
}

h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  line-height: 1.3;
}
```

<Callout>
All those values **aren't** set in stone. **Experiment** and find the best values for yourself!
</Callout>

### Vertical Margin rem vs em
The value of margins are usually set in either `rem` or `em`. 

<Callout>
`em` is based on the **parent element's font size**. (scales based on font-size of parent/current element)

`rem` is based on the **root font size** (defaults to the `font-size` of `html`)
</Callout>

Most frameworks use `rem` for everything because it's predictable—everything scales from the root font size. But this approach treats all spacing the same, which creates a problem.

When you use `rem` for margins, a large heading and small body text get the same proportional spacing. This breaks the natural relationship between text size and the space around it. In good typography, larger text needs proportionally larger margins to maintain visual balance.

**A better approach**: Use `rem` for font-sizes to keep your typography scale consistent, but use `em` for margins and padding so spacing scales with the actual content.

<InteractivePlayground
layout="horizontal"
width="1300px"
options={[
  {
    name: "FontSizeExample",
    type: "slider",
    min: 1.5,
    default: 2.5,
    max: 4,
    step: 0.1,
    unit: "rem",
    label: "Heading font-size",
    property: "font-size",
    targetClass: ".margin-example h2"
  },
  {
    name: "ExampleMarginBottom",
    label: "Margin units",
    type: "select",
    options: [
      {
        value: "rem",
        label: "rem",
        properties: [
          { property: "margin-bottom", value: "0.5rem" },
          { property: "margin-top", value: "1rem" }
        ]
      },
      {
        value: "em",
        label: "em",
        properties: [
          { property: "margin-bottom", value: "0.5em" },
          { property: "margin-top", value: "1em" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    targetClass: ".margin-example h2"
  }
]
}
    >
  <div className="margin-example">
    <h2>This is a heading.</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ipsum eligendi, dolorem saepe itaque similique assumenda, necessitatibus delectus accusamus quam magnam dolores voluptatibus sed tempore ducimus sapien.te n</p>
    <h2>This is also a heading.</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Vitae, perspiciatis ducimus. Tempore aspernatur excepturi voluptatibus voluptatum velit, ut natus corporis illum assumenda. Quo voluptatem tempore optio paria</p>
  </div>
</InteractivePlayground>

When you **increase** a heading's font-size, the margins **increase proportionally** without manual adjustment. The visual rhythm stays intact.

### Vertical Margin Guidelines
The spacing between elements is quite complex, you can use formulas, but a great starting point is:
1. Headings **must** have **more top spacing** than bottom spacing.
2. All other elements must have the **same spacing** at the top and bottom. 
<Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="typography.css">
```css
body {
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem;
  margin: 1.25em 0;
}

h1 {
  margin-top: 2.5em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}

h2 {
  margin-top: 2em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}

pre {
  margin: 0 1.7em;
}

/* Rest of code... */
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
And amazing example following this principle is [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography). They also use `em` for margin spacing.

## Conclusion

Good typography isn't about rigid rules—it's about creating systems that work consistently across your project. By establishing a CSS reset, implementing a mathematical typescale, and applying thoughtful vertical spacing, you've built a framework that eliminates guesswork and creates visual harmony.

These techniques give you consistency through systematic relationships, maintainability with scalable CSS properties, and professional polish that users notice subconsciously.

Remember: these are starting points, not absolute laws. Every project has unique needs. Use these principles as your foundation, then adapt based on your content and audience. Consider exploring fluid typography with clamp() and container queries for even more responsive designs.

Most importantly, test with real users and content. The best typographic system serves your readers first. When typography feels invisible—when users focus entirely on content without fighting poor readability—you've succeeded.

Start with these fundamentals, iterate based on feedback, and watch systematic typography transform how your site feels to use.
