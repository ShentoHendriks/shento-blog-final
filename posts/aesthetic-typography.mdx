## Using a Modern CSS Reset
Before you start creating typography, you should **always** first use a CSS Reset

Why? Every browser has different default styles—margins, padding, and font sizing that create inconsistencies across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. A CSS reset eliminates these differences, giving you a clean foundation for consistent typography.

  <TabPanel title="Example reset.css">
```css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

* {
  margin: 0;
}
// ... more lines here
```
  </TabPanel>

Many developers use [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), but [Josh Comeau's Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) is a better choice. While Meyer's reset aggressively strips all browser defaults, Comeau's approach is smarter—it removes inconsistencies while preserving useful behaviors.


### Key advantages of Comeau's reset:

- Universal box-sizing: `border-box`
- Better font rendering and typography defaults
- Preserves accessibility features
- Built for modern CSS (flexbox, grid)

If you use Tailwind CSS, you have a built-in CSS Reset called '[Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)'.

## Why You Need a Typescale
Without a systematic approach to font sizing, your typography becomes inconsistent and chaotic. You'll find yourself randomly picking sizes—making H2 headings 22px, then 24px, then 20px—creating visual discord that feels unprofessional and hard to scan.

### Establishing Your Typescale

A **typescale** solves this by creating consistent relationships between all your text elements. Start with your base font size: **16px** or **18px**—these are universally acknowledged as optimal for body text readability across devices and age groups.


From this foundation, use mathematical ratios to generate harmonious size relationships:

- Larger sizes for headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Smaller sizes for captions, footnotes, and labels
- Consistent spacing that creates visual rhythm (more about this later).

Popular typescale ratios include:

- **1.125 (Major Second)** - subtle, conservative
- **1.25 (Major Third)** - balanced, versatile
- **1.414 (Augmented Fourth)** - dynamic, bold

Tools like [typescale.com](https://typescale.com) can generate your complete typescale automatically.

## Vertical Spacing

Vertical spacing refers to all the space that appears above and below text elements on your page. This includes **line-height** for web developers, but also known as **leading** for designers. It's basically just the space between lines within a paragraph. Vertical spacing also includes **margin** (space between different elements like headings, paragraphs, and sections).

Poor vertical spacing **destroys** readability. Text that's cramped together feels suffocating and hard to scan, while excessive spacing makes content feel disconnected and scattered. Good vertical spacing creates rhythm, guides the eye naturally through content, and makes your typography feel polished and professional.

### Recommended Guidelines
For **line-height**, the following are usually recommended:
- **Body text**: 1.5
- **Large headings (H1-H2)**: 1.2
- **Smaller headings (H3-H6)**: 1.3

For **margins** between elements:
- **H1**: 5rem above, 2rem below
- **H2**: 4rem above, 1.5rem below
- **H3**: 3rem above, 1rem below
- **H4-H6**: 2.5rem above, 1rem below
- **Paragraphs**: No top margin, 1.5rem bottom margin
- **Lists**: No top margin, 1.5rem bottom margin
- **Images/Videos**: 3rem top and bottom margin
