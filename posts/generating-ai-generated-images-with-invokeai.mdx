## Introduction
InvokeAI is a powerful, open-source application that lets you generate AI images directly on your computer—no internet connection or subscription required. Unlike cloud-based services, InvokeAI gives you complete control over your creative process with features like:
- **Unified Canvas:** Create and edit images in one seamless workspace
- **Advanced Prompting:** Fine-tune your results with detailed text descriptions
- **Inpainting/Outpainting:** Edit specific parts of images or expand them beyond their borders
- **Model Management:** Easy installation and switching between different AI models
- **One-Click Installation:** Simpler setup than most competitors

## Requirements
- **A modern Graphics Card (GPU):** Something like an NVIDIA RTX 3050 model or newer is recommended.
- **At least 8 GB of RAM (Memory):** More is often better, but 8GB is the minimum.
- **Storage:** At least 10GB free space for the application and models

## Install
Go to the [official page](https://www.invoke.com/downloads) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

## Downloading models
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Model Manager">
  After installation, you'll need to download AI models before generating images. Open InvokeAI and click the **Model Manager** icon (the square icon, 4th from the left).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Installing a Starter Model">
  Navigate to **Starter Models**, and you'll see a list of different models. Choose models based on your hardware:
-  **If you have a powerful computer**: install `Flux` or `SDXL` models.
-  **if you have a weaker PC**: install `SD1.X`  models.
-  **Recommended starter:** `Juggernaut XL v9` (excellent for photorealistic images)

Click on the `+` icon to install them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prune clean-up">
  After the installation is done, click on `Prune` to clear the queue. This is good practice as it will free up resources and clear cache.

## Generating images

### Selecting your model
Navigate to the canvas (1st icon), go to `Generation` > `Model`, and make sure you selected your downloaded model.

### Important settings 

The settings of InvokeAI are straightforward once you understand them.

`Positive Prompt:` Descriptive text that tells the AI what you **want to create**, including subjects, style, composition, and visual elements.

*Example: "A serene mountain lake at sunset, oil painting style, warm golden lighting, reflections on water"*

`Negative Prompt:` Descriptive text **specifying unwanted elements**, styles, or quality issues to exclude from the generated image.

*Example: "blurry, low quality, extra limbs, distorted faces, watermark, text"*


`Aspect`: The proportional relationship between **width and height** of the generated image, expressed as a ratio.


`Seed`: A numerical value that determines the **randomness** pattern for image generation, allowing reproducible results when kept constant.

### Prompting

This is what I entered in my Postive Prompt, and then pressed `Invoke`, which generates the image.

```md
A beautiful fantasy castle during the sunset
with an irish landscape.
```
### The result
After a few seconds, the result was quite interesting. The image generated really beautiful.

## Advanced Settings
There are also advanced settings, the most impactful one are those under `Generation`. If you reveal those options you see: `Scheduler`, `Steps`, and `CFG Scale`.

### Scheduler
Controls the **algorithm** that guides how the AI transitions from **random noise** to your final image. Think of it as the "pace and style" of the generation process.

Popular schedulers like `Euler a` (Best for beginners due to its speed and efficiency. Works well at lower step counts (15-30 steps). Tends to generate diverse results quickly but may sacrifice fine details. Ideal for brainstorming or quick iterations.)

`PM Family` (DPM++, DPM2, etc.) **Widely recommended** for high-quality results once you know your prompt. Typically requires **20-40 steps** for optimal output. `DPM++ 2M Karras` is a community favorite for its balance of quality and efficiency. Avoid at low step counts (\<15).

`LMS/DDIM` Best for **sharp images** with well-defined subjects (e.g., portraits). Requires moderate steps (25-35). More consistent than Euler a but slower. **Ideal for final renders.**

### Steps
Determines how many refinement cycles the AI performs during image creation. **Higher step** counts (e.g., 30-50) allow more iterations to refine details and textures, generally improving quality but requiring more processing time. **Lower steps** (e.g., 15-25) speed up generation but *may* compromise detail. The ideal setting varies based on your hardware and image complexity.

### CFG Scale
**Classifier-Free Guidance Scale** determines how strictly the AI adheres to your text prompt. Lower values (1-5) grant the model creative freedom, potentially deviating from your description for more artistic interpretations. Higher values (7-15) enforce tighter prompt alignment but risk producing stiff or unnatural-looking images. Medium values (5-8) typically balance creativity and fidelity.
