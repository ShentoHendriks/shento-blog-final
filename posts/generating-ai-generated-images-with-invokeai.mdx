## Introduction
InvokeAI is a user-friendly, locally-run generative AI platform for creating high-quality visual media. It offers a unified canvas, workflow manager, advanced prompting, inpainting/outpainting, and robust model management. Its one-click installer makes it exceptionally accessible compared to competitors.

### Requirements
- **A modern Graphics Card (GPU):** Something like an NVIDIA RTX 3050 model or newer is recommended.
- **At least 8 GB of RAM (Memory):** More is often better, but 8GB is the minimum.

## Installing InvokeAI
Go to the [official page](https://www.invoke.com/downloads) and download the version suitable for your system. Then follow the installation instructions to install InvokeAI on your computer.

## Installing models
After finishing the installation, you **must** install some models. Click on the square icon.

Navigate to **Starter Models**, and you'll see a list of different models. The differences will be explained later. If you have a powerful computer, install `SDXL` models, if you have a weaker PC, install `SD1.X` models. Click on the `+` icon to install them.

I will install **Juggernaut XL v9** as this model is good for photograph-focused images.
