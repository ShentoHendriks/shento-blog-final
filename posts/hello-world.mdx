## How Grid changed the game

Think of CSS Grid as a two-dimensional playground for your content. Unlike older methods that force you to think in terms of rows OR columns, Grid lets you work with both simultaneously. You create a container, define your grid structure, and then place items exactly where they belong. It's like having a perfectly organized filing system instead of throwing papers into boxes and hoping for the best.

## Responsive design that _actually_ works

What makes Grid truly special is how it handles responsive design. Remember spending hours writing media queries to make layouts work on different screen sizes? Grid's fractional units and built-in functions like `minmax()` and `repeat()` make responsive layouts feel almost magical. Your content automatically adapts and flows based on available space, creating designs that look intentional rather than forced.

I love the following:
1. Cheese
2. Bacon
    - Cheese
    - Cheese

That's why I love cheese
