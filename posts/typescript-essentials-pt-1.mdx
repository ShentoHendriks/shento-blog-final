title: Typescript Essentials pt. 1
description: "Imagine you're building a large application with a team. One developer writes a function that expects a user object with specific properties, but another developer calls it with a string by mistake. In JavaScript, you won't discover this error until the code runs in production and crashes. The solution? TypeScript."

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript

## Introduction
TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional **type annotations** and compiles to plain JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.

<Callout>
TypeScript is called a superset of JavaScript because every valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, but TypeScript adds additional features (like types) on top of JavaScript's existing syntax.

  <TabPanel title="example.ts">
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

const goodExample = add(5, 5);
const badExample = add("5", 5); // will give an error
```

## Your First TypeScript code
Follow these steps to create your first TypeScript code.

<Steps width="800px">
  <Step title="Installing TypeScript">
  Open your Terminal and install TypeScript.
    <Tabs>
      <TabPanel title="Terminal">
```sh
npm install -g typescript
```
      </TabPanel>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="First TypeScript Code">
  After you installed it, create a file named `index.ts` (this can be any name you want). Add the following code:
    <Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="index.ts">
```ts
let message: string;
message = "Hello World!";

console.log(message);
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compile to JavaScript">
Compile the TypeScript file to Javascript.
    <Tabs>
  <TabPanel title="Terminal">
```sh
tsc index.ts
node index.js
```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>


## More elegant set-up
Every time you make changes to your `.ts` file, you must repeat the steps of first compiling it using `tsc`, then running it to actually see your changes. Because this is cumbersome, there's a more elegant way to automate this using [tsx](https://tsx.is/).

**tsx** stands for TypeScript Execute and it's a Node.js enhancement to run TypeScript.
So instead of doing all those previous steps, we can just run `tsx index.ts`

Let's first install `tsx` and let it run everytime we save the file. This saves a lot of work.
```sh
npm install --save-dev tsx
npx tsx watch index.ts
```
